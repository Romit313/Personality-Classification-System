# Personality-Classification-System
Developed a system that classifies users based on the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) to enhance targeted advertising and personality-based recruitment. The system provides insights into how personality traits influence leadership styles, communication effectiveness, and stress management. Applied data analysis techniques to assess user behavior and generate personalized insights, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions in marketing and hiring strategies.
