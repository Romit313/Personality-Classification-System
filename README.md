# Personality-Classification-System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a personality classification system based on the Big Five Personality Traits model. The system takes user inputs about their personality characteristics and classifies their personality type, which can be used for various purposes, such as recruitment, social networks, and targeted advertisement delivery. 

The system uses machine learning algorithms to classify and predict a user's personality based on their responses. The model is built to predict the following five personality traits:

1. Openness to Experience
2. Conscientiousness
3. Extraversion
4. Agreeableness
5. Neuroticism

## Key Features

- **Big Five Personality Traits**: The system uses the Big Five Personality Traits model for personality classification.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict personality based on user input.
- **Recruitment System**: The system can be used by organizations to assess candidates' personalities and find the best fit for various job profiles.
- **Data-Driven**: Uses a data-driven approach to classify and predict personality based on past classifications and behavioral data.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the system.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical and scientific computation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization and plotting graphs.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Future Work

- **Integration with Recruitment Systems**: We aim to integrate this system into recruitment tools to streamline the hiring process.
- **Real-time Personality Prediction**: Future versions could provide real-time personality prediction in response to dynamic user inputs.
- **Improved Models**: We plan to explore more advanced machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

## Acknowledgments

- The Big Five Personality Traits model is widely used in psychology and research.
